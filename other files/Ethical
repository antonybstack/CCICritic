Because of the ability for any student to leave any form of text entry as a review, heavy moderation will need to occur to keep civility. The ethical reasoning behind this is to reduce the amount of purely negative comments and instead, focus communication efforts between students and teacher to be constructive criticism.
Students accounts are linked to their school account therefor to ethically secure their information the the data students enter will need to be encrypted and safe. Ethically, this means that anyone should not be able to collect personal data that does not belong to them. 
Address any features in your project that could be misused and how you plan to guard against misuse. For example, if you plan to allow images to be uploaded by users, will you include a way for other users to report inappropriate images or use some other strategy?
The student's reviews will have the ability to be marked for spam/ inappropriate content. A built in content filter will be implemented to prevent users from leaving distasteful reviews.
